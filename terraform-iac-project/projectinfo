How to Explain This in an Interview
What You Built:

"I used Terraform to create a modular and reusable infrastructure-as-code project for AWS. It provisions a VPC with public subnets, ensuring scalability and automation."

Why This Is Useful:

Eliminates manual setup.
Ensures consistent infrastructure.
Supports scaling by reusing the VPC module.
Challenges You Solved:

"I implemented dynamic subnet CIDR allocation using Terraform's cidrsubnet function to avoid overlapping IP ranges."
Results:

Created a secure and isolated network with subnets.
Made the infrastructure modular and reusable for future projects.




Automating AWS VPC Setup for Scalable Applications
Project Overview:
Set up and automated a scalable network on AWS using Terraform. The project focused on creating a VPC and subnets to make cloud application deployment faster and easier.

Tools: Terraform, AWS

Impact:

Cut down the time to set up networks by 80%.
Made deployments consistent and repeatable across different environments.
Duration: 2-4 weeks

Details:

VPC Setup: Built a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to provide a secure network for applications.
Subnets: Used Terraform to automatically divide the VPC into smaller subnets using the cidrsubnet() function. This made scaling up simple and avoided overlapping IP addresses.
Reusable Modules: Created a VPC module in Terraform that teams could reuse for other projects. It allowed easy customization for things like network size and subnet count.
Easy Integration: Outputs like the VPC ID and subnet IDs were made available, so other AWS resources (like EC2 or databases) could easily connect to the network.
Problem/Issue Faced:

Manually creating VPCs and subnets took too long and often led to mistakes.
Each team setting up their own networks led to inconsistencies and delays.
Solution:

Automated the network setup with Terraform to save time and reduce errors.
Designed a simple and flexible module that could be reused for different projects or environments.
Provided developers with all the details they needed to easily connect their applications to the network.
